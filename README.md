# Final-Project
A repository of my final project report submitted to fulfill the requirements for the MSc in Quantum Science and Technology at Trinity College Dublin.
The project is about the simulation of a central spin qubit of the organometallic sandwich compound [CpTi(cot)] within a spin bath. The PyCCE library is used for the simulation.

## The project includes:
Import the necessary libraries for the simulation.

Call an .xyz file containing coordinates of the atoms inside a unit cell.

Set the simulation parameters.

Run the simulator following the instructions contained in the documentation: https://pycce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Creation of graphs to obtain appropriate visualization of consistency with respect to various parameters.
